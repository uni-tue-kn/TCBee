# TCBee

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (1.82 or newer): `rustup toolchain install stable`
- clang 11 or newer, to compile the eBPF programs in `tcbee/src/bpf/`
- libclang, used by bindgen for the shared record layout (`tcbee/src/bpf/records.h`)
- libelf and zlib development headers, found through pkg-config, plus make and a C compiler
  for the bundled libbpf

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install -y clang libclang-dev libelf-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config make
```

No nightly toolchain or `bpf-linker` is needed.

## Build & Run

```shell
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/tcbee-record -h eth0 -k
# or
cargo run --release --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E"' -- -h eth0 -k
```

The build script compiles `tcbee/src/bpf/tcbee.bpf.c` with clang against the vendored
`vmlinux.h` and embeds it through a libbpf-rs skeleton. The header contains only the kernel
declarations this program uses, based on a `bpftool btf dump` of the BTF from
`7.2.6-arch2-1` on x86_64. The full generated snapshot is retained in git history at
`62d6a14` (SHA-256: `a6f878f35ad62431d24155959ec44570b7d8c3faab90f5ea796f2b75d5e28dbf`).
Builds do not need `bpftool` or the build host's kernel BTF. Kernel struct offsets are
relocated against the running kernel's BTF at load time (CO-RE), so one binary runs on
different kernels. Update the compact header when the BPF program reads new kernel fields.

By default libbpf is linked statically and libelf and zlib dynamically. Release builds use

```shell
cargo build --release --features static
```

which builds libelf and zlib from source as well and links all three statically, so the
binary only needs glibc. This additionally needs autoconf, automake, autopoint (gettext),
libtool, flex, bison and gawk:

```shell
sudo apt install -y autoconf automake autopoint gettext libtool flex bison gawk
```

## Kernel requirements

- BTF of the running kernel (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`, `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`)
- BPF ring buffers: 5.8, enough for `-h` and `-t` (the `tcp_bad_csum` tracepoint of `-t`
  appeared in 5.11)
- `-k`, `-w`, `-a` use fentry programs and `bpf_skc_to_tcp_sock`: 5.9
- `-a` with CUBIC or BBR built as a module needs module BTF (5.11). BBR is only traced if
  `tcp_bbr` is loaded (or built in) when tcbee-record starts; otherwise it records CUBIC only
  and logs an error. Load it beforehand with `sudo modprobe tcp_bbr`.
- `-h` attaches with tcx on 6.6 and newer. Older kernels use a clsact qdisc, which
  tcbee-record creates through netlink (no `tc` command needed) and removes again on exit
  if it created it.

## Filtering

By default no filter is enabled, so probes only take the fast no-filter branch.

Use `-p`/`--port` for the fastest filtered mode when you only need one local or remote port:

```shell
cargo run --release --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E"' -- -k --port 443
```

For more flexible filtering, use the map-backed filter options:

```shell
--ports 80,443
--src-ports 12345
--dst-ports 443
--ips 10.0.0.1,2001:db8::1
--src-ips 10.0.0.10
--dst-ips 10.0.0.20
```

Ports and IPs are exact matches. `--ports` and `--ips` match either source or destination;
the `src`/`dst` variants require that direction. Values inside the same option are ORed.
Different dimensions are ANDed, so `--ports 80,443 --ips 10.0.0.1` records traffic where
either endpoint port is 80 or 443 and either endpoint IP is `10.0.0.1`.
